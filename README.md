# CSFL-Non-IID-data

Fedrated Learning with Non-IID data
=============
### We are highly thankful to our professor, Dr. Hari Prabhat Gupta, Assistant Professor of Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Varanasi, for his teaching, guidance and constant supervision regarding the project and also for his support in completing the project. It was a great privilege and honor to work and study under his guidance ###

Introduction
